# and this pep is just like js just hte names might be different variable_name:type = value

# naked vars means they dont have a specific types in a same long code since types is free in python

# a var ight be int in start float in middle and str in end but we gotta use it in a way ensuring the vars type will not be needed to change in future of code



# int its same if we use _ or not so we can utilize it to understand the code better

# conversion methods are like bin() dec() hex() oct() and will return 

# 0'system determiner'value

# true = 1 false = 0
